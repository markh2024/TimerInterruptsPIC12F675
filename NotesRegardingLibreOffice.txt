REM Notes about other code 
REM These  functions are built in 
REM =CONCAT("0x",DEC2HEX(H7,2))  this  is entered into column J 
REM =CONCAT("0b000",C7:G7)  this is entered into Column I 
REM =BIN2DEC(MID(I7,3,8)) this is entered into Column H 

' Bare in mind  that you have to understand what these functions  do   but this
' is how I  work out truth tables  to plug into code 
' Ive produced this to show  you   how to use   spreadsheets  to your advantage  using
' With automation in mind  
' You can  do much more than just this  and its possiblities are endless 
' auto email , networking , security , iot  you name it 
' That is all in your hands  and how you  implement  knowledge
